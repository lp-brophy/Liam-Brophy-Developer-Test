# Liam-Brophy-Developer-Test
Developer Test for Rook Studio

## Running the App
Extract all files to the same folder and open "index.html" in a web browser to run the App.

## Description
Display 6 red cards.

When a card is clicked on, its number appears and the card turns green. 

Only one green card is displayed at a time, all others are red with no number.

A "Toggle Kittens" button will place pictures of kittens on the cards instead of being red. The green functionality still works in this mode, as described above.

An "Add Card" button will add an extra card to the deck.

A "Remove Card" button will remove a card from the deck.
